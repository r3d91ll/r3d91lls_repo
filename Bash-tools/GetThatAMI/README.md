# AWS GetThatAMI.sh Script

The `GetThatAMI.sh` script is designed to assist in retrieving the latest Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs for popular Linux distributions available on AWS. It streamlines the process of identifying up-to-date AMIs, ensuring an efficient setup for your AWS projects.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to utilize the script effectively:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is installed and configured on your system.
   - Confirm that your AWS CLI has the necessary permissions to perform the operations.

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   - Modify the script permissions to make it executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x getthatami.sh
     ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script to obtain the latest AMI IDs:
     ```bash
     ./getthatami.sh
     ```

The script will display the latest AMI IDs for the specified Linux distributions.

## Extending the Script for Other Distributions

To adapt the script for additional Linux or Windows distributions, follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Naming Pattern:**
   - Identify the unique naming pattern for the AMIs of your desired distribution (e.g., `ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server*` for Ubuntu 20.04).

2. **Identify the Owner:**
   - Find out the AWS account ID that owns the official AMIs for the distribution (e.g., Canonical's account `099720109477` for Ubuntu).

3. **Update the `os_filters` Array:**
   - Add a new entry to the `os_filters` associative array in the script:
     ```bash
     os_filters["YourDistName"]="Name=name,Values=your-pattern*"
     ```

4. **Modify the Loop (If Necessary):**
   - Adjust the script's loop to accommodate any unique requirements for your chosen distribution, such as different owner accounts or special filters.

Note: For Windows AMIs, a similar approach applies, but with different naming patterns and owner IDs. Consult AWS documentation or the EC2 console for specific details on Windows AMIs.
