# RoyClass Overview

## Introduction

RoyClass is a crucial component of the NexusPatcher tool, designed to conduct comprehensive quality checks on systems both before and after patching operations. Named after Roy Batty, a character known for precision and thoroughness, this class ensures that systems are fully operational and ready for service.

## Key Responsibilities

### Service Status Checks

- Function: `check_service_status`
- Description: Verifies the status of critical system services to ensure they are operational. This check is vital for confirming that essential services are not impacted by patching processes.
- Output: A report detailing the operational status of each checked service.

### System Health Checks

- Function: `validate_system_health`
- Description: Assesses the overall health of the system, including metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and load averages. Essential for ensuring that the system is performing optimally.
- Output: Health metrics report indicating the current performance status of the system.

### Kernel Version Validation

- Function: `confirm_kernel_version`
- Description: Post-patch, confirms that the expected kernel version is running, ensuring that kernel updates have been successfully applied.
- Output: Verification report of the kernel version.

### Startup Log Review

- Function: `review_startup_logs`
- Description: Checks system logs for any errors or warnings that occurred during startup, identifying potential issues that need attention.
- Output: Summary of critical log entries that may indicate problems.

### Network Connectivity Tests

- Function: `test_network_connectivity`
- Description: Ensures the system can communicate with necessary network resources and endpoints, verifying that network connectivity is not compromised.
- Output: Report on network connectivity status.

### Disk Space Validation

- Function: `validate_disk_space`
- Description: Confirms sufficient disk space availability post-operations, utilizing the MercerClass for detailed analysis.
- Output: Disk space assessment report.

### Integration with Other Components

- DeckardClass and BryantClass: Provides essential pre- and post-operation checks to support these classes in the patching process.
- MercerClass: Integrates with MercerClass for in-depth disk space analysis.

## Packaging and Installation

- Location: Installed as part of the NexusPatcher suite at `/opt/rackspace/racktools/NexusPatcher`.
- Operational Use: Invoked as part of the patching preparation and validation process, but also usable independently for routine system checks.

## Logging and Reporting

- Logging: Detailed logs of all checks and findings are maintained, providing a clear record of system status.
- Path: Logs are stored within `/var/log/racktools/NexusPatcher`, aligning with NexusPatcher's logging strategy.

## Security and Compliance

- Secure Operations: Ensures that all checks are performed securely, maintaining system integrity.
- Compliance Adherence: Regularly updated to align with security best practices and organizational standards.
