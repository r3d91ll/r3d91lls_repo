# NexusPatcher: Packaging and Distribution Overview

## Introduction

The NexusPatcher tool is designed to be packaged and distributed efficiently, ensuring ease of installation, updates, and maintenance across various systems. The tool is primarily targeted for RHEL-based systems and will be distributed as an RPM package.

## Key Strategies

### RPM Packaging

- Approach: Package NexusPatcher as an RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) file. This format is widely used in RHEL-based distributions and facilitates easy installation and updates.
- Contents: The package will include all necessary binaries, scripts (DeckardClass, BryantClass, MercerClass, and RoyClass), and configuration files.
- Dependencies: The package will specify all necessary dependencies to ensure smooth installation and operation of the tool.

### Installation Directory

- Path: `/opt/rackspace/racktools/NexusPatcher`
- Rationale: Installing the tool in a dedicated directory under `/opt` ensures separation from the system's default directories and aligns with organizational standards.

### Configuration File Setup

- First Run Configuration: On the first run, NexusPatcher will generate a configuration file in its installation directory. This file will store essential settings and parameters for the tool's operation.

### Version Control and Updates

- Repository Management: Host the RPM package in a repository for easy access and version control.
- Update Mechanism: Leverage the package manager's update capabilities to distribute and apply updates to NexusPatcher.

## Security and Compliance

### Secure Packaging

- Best Practices: Adhere to security best practices in packaging, ensuring that the package does not introduce vulnerabilities.
- Post-Installation Scripts: Include secure post-installation scripts in the RPM package for setup and configuration.

### Compliance with Standards

- Organizational Policies: Ensure that the packaging and distribution methods comply with organizational standards and policies.
- Regular Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the package and its contents.

## Documentation and Training
