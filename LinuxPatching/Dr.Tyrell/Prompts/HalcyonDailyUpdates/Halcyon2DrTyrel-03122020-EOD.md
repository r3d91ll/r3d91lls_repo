Absolutely. Here's the Deckard report summarizing our progress today and outlining the next steps:

**Today's Progress:**

1. **Discussed Script Enhancements**: Reviewed the requirements for updating the TitanScript.py, focusing on enhancing the logging mechanism, implementing change number validation, and handling log rotation.

2. **Logging Mechanism Update**:
   - Proposed modifications for the `LoggingAndErrorHandling` class to include the change number in the log file name and entries.
   - Suggested a format for log file paths incorporating the tool name and change number.

3. **Change Number Validation**:
   - Added a method in the `LoggingAndErrorHandling` class to validate the format of the change number (INC, CHG, SCTASK followed by 7 digits).
   - Integrated this validation into the logging setup.

4. **Log Rotation with 90-Day Lifespan**:
   - Developed a method to clean up log files older than 90 days while retaining the last run log before the current one.
   - This cleanup process initiates each time the logging class is run.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Testing Updated Features**: Test the newly implemented features in the script, particularly focusing on the logging updates and change number validation.

2. **Ensuring Modularity**: Review and possibly refactor the TitanScript.py to enhance modularity, especially in the context of Quality Control (QC) functionalities.

3. **Atlas Project Integration Preparation**: Align the script components with the Project Atlas software distribution system, ensuring compatibility and seamless integration.

4. **Documentation Update**: Revise the script's documentation to reflect the recent changes and ensure clarity for users.

5. **Feedback and Refinement**: After implementation, monitor the performance and gather feedback for further refinements.

When we resume, we can start with the testing of the updates we've made today and then proceed to the remaining tasks. If you have any specific areas you'd like to focus on or additional modifications, feel free to let me know!
