- [LinuxPrePatchChecks-Python3.py](https://github.com/r3d91ll/r3d91lls_repo/blob/main/LinuxPatching/LinuxPrePatchChecks-Python3.py): A Python 3 script for conducting pre-patch checks on Linux systems.
  
- [LinuxPrePatchChecks.sh](https://github.com/r3d91ll/r3d91lls_repo/blob/main/LinuxPatching/LinuxPrePatchChecks.sh): A Bash script for conducting pre-patch checks on Linux systems.
  
- [linux-kernels.json](https://github.com/r3d91ll/r3d91lls_repo/blob/main/LinuxPatching/linux-kernels.json): A JSON file containing data related to Linux kernels.

## Quick Start

To use the pre-patch check scripts, ensure you have the appropriate version of Python installed and execute the script on your Linux system. For Bash scripts, ensure they have execute permissions and run them in your Linux environment.

Example for running a Python script:
```bash
python LinuxPrePatchChecks-Python3.py
```

Example for running a Bash script:
```bash
chmod +x LinuxPrePatchChecks.sh
./LinuxPrePatchChecks.sh
```

## Additional Information

Detailed documentation for each script will be provided soon, offering insights into their usage, options, and output.
