# PrePatch Checks Script

The PrePatch Checks script is designed to perform pre-patch checks on a system and execute the appropriate Python script based on the available Python version. The script is written in Bash and supports both Python 2.7 and Python 3.

## Usage

1. Run the `prepatch_checks.sh` Bash script.

   ```bash
   bash prepatch_checks.sh
   ```

2. The script will check the available Python version on the system.

3. If Python 2.7 is available, it will download the Python 2.7 script from the provided URL and execute it.

4. If Python 3 is available, it will download the Python 3 script from the provided URL and execute it.

5. The appropriate Python script will perform the necessary pre-patch checks and generate a report.

6. The Python script will create a `patchme.sh` script in the `/root/$changenumber/` directory. This `patchme.sh` script contains the commands to apply the necessary patches or updates.

## Files and Directories

The script creates the following files and directories:

- `prepatch_checks.sh`: The Bash script that checks the Python version and executes the appropriate Python script.
- `LinuxPrePatchChecks-Python2.7.py`: The Python 2.7 script that performs pre-patch checks if Python 2.7 is available.
- `LinuxPrePatchChecks-Python3.py`: The Python 3 script that performs pre-patch checks if Python 3 is available.
- `debug.log`: The log file that captures debug messages from the script.
- `pre-patch.report`: The report file generated by the Python script, containing pre-patch check results.
- `/root/$changenumber/`: The directory where the `patchme.sh` script is created.

## Requirements

- Python 2.7 or Python 3 installed on the system.
- `wget` command-line tool for downloading the Python scripts.

## Notes

- If neither Python 2.7 nor Python 3 is available, the script will display an error message and exit.
- Ensure that the provided URLs for the Python scripts are correct and accessible.
- The Python scripts can be customized to perform specific pre-patch checks based on your requirements.
- The `patchme.sh` script created by the Python script contains the necessary commands to apply the patches or updates and is located in the `/root/$changenumber/` directory.
