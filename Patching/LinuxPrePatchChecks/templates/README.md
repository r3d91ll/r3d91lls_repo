The CloudFormation template you provided is valid and correct in syntax. It creates an SSM document that allows the execution of the LinuxPrePatchChecks.py script on instances with a provided `ChangeNumber` parameter. 

Here is a README.md for your CloudFormation template:

# LinuxPrePatchCheck CloudFormation Template

This repository contains a CloudFormation template for creating an AWS Systems Manager (SSM) document. The SSM document allows the execution of the LinuxPrePatchChecks.py script on instances. 

## Usage

1. **Upload the CloudFormation template to AWS.**
You can do this via the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI. For example, if you're using the CLI:

```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name MyStack --template-body file://template.yaml --parameters ParameterKey=ChangeNumber,ParameterValue=MyValue
```

2. **Run the SSM document on your instances.**
Once the stack creation is successful, you can run the SSM document on your instances. You will need to provide a `ChangeNumber` parameter.

## About the Script

The LinuxPrePatchChecks.py script performs various pre-patch checks on Linux instances. The script will:

1. Get the instance ID
2. Clean and update yum
3. Get the repo list
4. List available kernels
5. Get the running kernel version
6. Get kernel update packages
7. Check CrowdStrike version and state
8. Check yum security updates

The script will output the results of these checks to a .csv file.

The script also uses debug mode by default, logging the executed commands and their outputs. To disable debug mode, set `DEBUG_MODE` to `False`.

The script requires the `ChangeNumber` environment variable to be set. If not set, it will default to 'DEFAULT_CHANGE_NUMBER'.
