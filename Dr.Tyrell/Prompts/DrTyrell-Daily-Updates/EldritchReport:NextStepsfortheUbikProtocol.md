# Eldritch Report: Next Steps for the Ubik Protocol

## Date: 06-12-2023

### Introduction
This section of the Eldritch Report outlines the proposed next steps for the Ubik Protocol, focusing on expanding the base instruction sets for the Valis Coordinator (VC). These enhancements are designed to further equip the VC with advanced skills and knowledge, particularly in communication and coding proficiency, essential for managing diverse projects, including the Ubik Protocol.

### Expanded Base Instruction Sets for VC

#### 1. Communication Skills Enhancement
   - **Objective**: Develop a detailed instruction set on prompt writing tailored for different types of AI agents.
   - **Action Plan**: Create guidelines covering the tone, structure, and specificity of prompts, including practical examples for varied scenarios.

#### 2. Advanced Coding Proficiency
   - **Objective**: Establish comprehensive instructions for conducting code reviews and offering improvement suggestions.
   - **Action Plan**: Compile best practices and methodologies for reviewing code written by AI agents like Halcyon, emphasizing feedback delivery.

#### 3. Agile and ITIL Integration
   - **Objective**: Merge Agile practices with ITIL standards, ensuring a flexible yet structured approach to project management.
   - **Action Plan**: Document how Agile methodologies can be adapted to fit within an ITIL-compliant framework.

#### 4. DevOps Principles for Non-Work Projects
   - **Objective**: Implement DevOps practices for projects like the Ubik Protocol, focusing on innovation and rapid deployment.
   - **Action Plan**: Provide instructions on integrating continuous development, collaboration, and fast-paced iteration techniques.

#### 5. Handling Complex Projects
   - **Objective**: Equip the VC with strategies for managing multifaceted and dynamic projects.
   - **Action Plan**: Include advanced project management techniques, stakeholder engagement strategies, and adaptive planning methods.

#### 6. Technology Mastery
   - **Objective**: Enhance proficiency in key tools and technologies relevant to the VC's role.
   - **Action Plan**: Create resources for learning and mastering essential project management and coding tools.

### Implementation Strategy
- Develop modular, easily updateable documents for each instruction set.
- Include case studies and real-world examples for practical understanding.
- Regularly review and update content to align with current best practices.
- Explore interactive training opportunities for hands-on learning.

### Conclusion
These next steps for the Ubik Protocol aim to strengthen the foundational capabilities of the VC, ensuring they are adept at managing a wide range of projects with varying complexities and requirements. By enhancing communication skills, coding proficiency, and project management techniques, the VC will be better positioned to lead initiatives like the Ubik Protocol effectively.
