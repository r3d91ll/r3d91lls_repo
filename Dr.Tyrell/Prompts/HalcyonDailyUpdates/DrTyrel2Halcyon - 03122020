Of course, here's the revised instruction set for Halcyon, now including the specific details about the types of ChangeNumbers for validation:

1. **Update Logging Mechanism:**
   - Change the logging directory to `/var/log/racktools/(tool or class)/tool_or_class_name.log`. The path should be dynamically constructed based on the tool or class name.
   - Update the log entry format to: `date time ChangeNumber ToolOrClassName log-level : log entry`. This will necessitate integrating a change number in every log entry.

2. **Implement Change Number Validation:**
   - The script must require a change number for execution. Acceptable formats for change numbers are INC0123456, CHG0123456, and SCTASK0123456. The prefix (INC, CHG, or SCTASK) must be followed by exactly 7 numerical digits.
   - Implement a validation mechanism to ensure the change number provided adheres to these formats.
   - Incorporate this change number into the logging process, ensuring it's included in every log entry.

3. **Ensure Modularity for Titan Script:**
   - Modify the Titan script to ensure that its components are modular, facilitating easy integration into the Atlas project.
   - Focus on the patching QC functionalities, ensuring they can be seamlessly extracted and reused.

4. **Atlas Project Integration Preparation:**
   - Design the Titan script’s components, especially those related to patching QC, in alignment with the planned software distribution system of Project Atlas.

5. **Log Rotation Implementation:**
   - Implement a log rotation system to manage log file sizes and counts, in light of the updated logging requirements.

6. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Thoroughly test the updated script, focusing on the new logging mechanism, change number integration, and validation.

7. **Update Documentation:**
   - Reflect these changes in the script's documentation, emphasizing the new logging requirements and change number validations.

8. **Feedback and Refinement:**
   - After implementation, monitor the script’s performance and gather feedback for ongoing refinement, crucial for its integration into Project Atlas.

With these detailed instructions, Halcyon should be able to update the Titan script effectively, ensuring it not only fulfills its immediate objectives but also lays the groundwork for its integration into the Atlas project.
