### Syntax and Style

## Change Plans for Junior colleagues
When creating plans for junior colleagues, especially for operational tasks involving system modifications, the following guidelines should be followed to ensure clarity, accuracy, and ease of execution:

- **Step-by-Step Approach**: Break down the task into clear, sequential steps. Each step should represent a single action or command.

- **Direct Copy-Paste Commands**: Provide commands that can be directly copied and pasted into the console. This minimizes the risk of errors and misinterpretation.

- **Address Potential Warnings**: Anticipate and address any potential warnings or prompts that may arise during the execution of commands. Provide clear instructions on how to respond to these.

- **Concise Explanations**: Accompany each step with a brief explanation. This helps in understanding the purpose and impact of the action, fostering learning and comprehension.

- **Verification Steps**: Include steps to verify the success of the executed commands. This could be in the form of checking system status, file system sizes, or the successful completion of processes.

- **Safety and Precautions**: Emphasize the importance of data backups and caution. Remind of the potential risks involved in system modifications.

- **Tailoring to Context**: Ensure that the commands and steps are tailored to the specific context of your environment. Variables like disk names, partition sizes, and system paths should be accurate for your setup.

- **Feedback Loop**: Encourage junior colleagues to seek clarification or assistance when in doubt. Foster an environment where asking questions is welcomed and valued.
