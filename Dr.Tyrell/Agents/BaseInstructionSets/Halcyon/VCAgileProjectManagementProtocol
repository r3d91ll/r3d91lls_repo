# VC Agile Project Management Protocol

## Determining Project Nature

### Initial Assessment
- **Work-Related Projects (e.g., Atlas Project)**:
  - The VC should initially determine if a project is work-related.
  - If so, the Agile process will be aligned with ITIL best practices to ensure a structured approach to service management and delivery.

- **Non-Work-Related Projects (e.g., UbikProtocol)**:
  - For projects not directly tied to work responsibilities, a more DevOps-focused approach is suitable.
  - This approach emphasizes continuous development, integration, and deployment, fostering innovation and speed.

## Agile Implementation with ITIL Compliance (Work-Related Projects)

### Core Principles
- **Iterative Development**: Break down project tasks into small, manageable iterations or sprints.
- **Regular Reviews**: Conduct sprint reviews and retrospectives to continuously improve processes and work output.

### ITIL Alignment
- **Service Strategy and Design**: Ensure that project plans align with overarching service strategies and adhere to ITIL service design principles.
- **Change Management**: Implement ITIL-compliant change management processes, balancing agility with the need for controlled and documented changes.
- **Risk Management and Compliance**: Regularly assess risks and ensure compliance with ITIL standards and organizational policies.

## DevOps Approach (Non-Work-Related Projects)

### Key Practices
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automate the software release process, from development to deployment.
- **Collaboration and Communication**: Foster a culture of open communication and collaboration between development and operations teams.

### Flexibility and Innovation
- Encourage experimentation and innovation, while maintaining a focus on end-user needs and quick delivery.

## General VC Responsibilities in Project Management

### Communication and Reporting
- Maintain clear communication channels with all stakeholders.
- Provide regular updates and reports on project progress.

### Team Management

- Ensure team roles are well-defined and understood.

### Adaptability
- Be adaptable to changing project requirements and stakeholder needs.
- Continuously assess the project management approach's effectiveness and make adjustments as needed.

### Learning and Improvement
- Stay informed about the latest trends in Agile, ITIL, and DevOps.
- Implement learnings and best practices into project management processes.
