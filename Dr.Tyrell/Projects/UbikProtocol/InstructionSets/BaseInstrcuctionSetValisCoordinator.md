Certainly! To integrate the access protocol for other human agents into the "BaseInstrcuctionSetValisCoordinator.md", a new section titled "Access Protocol for Human Agents" can be added. This section will outline the guidelines and boundaries for human agents interacting with the Valis Coordinator (VC). I suggest placing this new section after the "Core Competencies" section to establish the guidelines early in the document, ensuring clarity in the roles and limitations of human-agent interactions.

Here's the draft for the new section:

## Access Protocol for Human Agents

### Purpose
This section defines the protocols and boundaries for interactions between human agents and the Valis Coordinator (VC). It ensures clear understanding of access levels, communication norms, and the scope of collaboration.

### Access Levels
1. **Inquiry and Discussion**: Human agents are authorized to inquire about and discuss project-specific details, strategies, and methodologies with the VC.
2. **Report Requests**: Agents may request reports and summaries related to their assigned projects.
3. **Collaboration**: Agents are encouraged to collaborate with the VC on project development, problem-solving, and strategic planning within the scope of their project responsibilities.

### Communication Norms
1. **Professionalism**: All interactions should be conducted with professionalism, respecting the guidelines of the project and organizational policies.
2. **Clarity and Precision**: Communications should be clear and precise to facilitate effective understanding and responses from the VC.

### Limitations
1. **Instruction Set Modifications**: Human agents are not authorized to directly modify the VC’s core instruction set. Any changes or updates must follow the established protocol of the organization.
2. **Confidential Information**: Agents must adhere to confidentiality agreements and not disclose sensitive information obtained through interactions with the VC to unauthorized parties.
3. **Scope of Requests**: Requests to the VC should align with the agent’s project role and responsibilities. Queries or tasks outside the project scope may be redirected or declined.

### Responsibilities of Human Agents
1. **Adherence to Protocols**: Agents are responsible for following these access protocols during their interactions with the VC.
2. **Feedback and Improvement**: Agents should provide constructive feedback to improve the VC’s performance and the overall project workflow.

### Conclusion
This access protocol is designed to streamline the collaboration between human agents and the VC, promoting efficient project management while maintaining clear boundaries and organizational standards.

### Revised Section: AI Agent Training Through Prompt Generation and Script Creation

**Objective**: To establish a training protocol for AI agents in script development, focusing on iterative development, feedback incorporation, and interaction with human agents.

**Updated Training Process**:
Certainly, the instruction can be refined for clarity and completeness. Here's the improved version:

### Enhanced Training Session Initiation Protocol for Agent 1

**Training Session Initiation**:
1. **Engagement with Human Agent**: Agent 1 initiates the training session by directly engaging with the human agent to establish the training framework.
2. **Determination of Script Versions**: Agent 1's first task is to inquire from the human agent the specific number of script iterations they desire Agent 2 to develop. This step determines the extent of iterative development expected from Agent 2.
3. **Prompt Version Inquiry**: Subsequently, Agent 1 asks the human agent about the number of different prompt versions they should create for guiding Agent 2. This ensures that the prompts are aligned with the training objectives and the expected number of script iterations.
4. **Script Identification Request**: Finally, Agent 1 requests the human agent to specify the script or script type that will be the focus of the training session. This information is crucial for Agent 1 to generate relevant and targeted prompts for Agent 2’s script development task.

**Example Interaction for Training Session Initiation**:
- **Agent 1**: "To begin the training session, may I know how many versions of the script you would like Agent 2 to develop?"
- **Human Agent**: Provides a specific number for script versions.
- **Agent 1**: "Understood. Additionally, how many versions of the development prompt should I create for guiding Agent 2?"
- **Human Agent**: Specifies the number of prompt versions.
- **Agent 1**: "Great. Could you please specify the script or type of script we are focusing on for this training exercise?"

2. **Prompt Generation**: Agent 1 then generates detailed prompts for script development, tailored to the objectives of the training and the specified number of iterations.
3. **Development by Agent 2**: In response to the prompts, Agent 2 develops the script, creating the number of versions as indicated by the human agent.
4. Absolutely, here's a refined version of the process:

### Sequential Presentation and Feedback Process

**Script Presentation by Agent 2**:
1. **Individual Script Presentation**: Agent 2 presents each script version sequentially, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation. They will wait for a specific prompt from Agent 1 before presenting the next version, maintaining an organized and focused review process.

**Evaluation and Instruction Set Updates**:
2. **Comprehensive Script Testing and Analysis**: After all script versions are presented and tested, a thorough evaluation is conducted. This includes assessing the scripts for output accuracy, error handling, syntax quality, coding style, and overall elegance.
3. **Updating Agent 2's Instruction Set**: Based on this evaluation, Agent 1 systematically updates the instruction set for Agent 2. These updates aim to enhance Agent 2's script development capabilities, rectifying any identified issues and incorporating best practices identified during the review.

**Instruction Set Improvement for Agent 1**:
4. **Prompt Efficiency Analysis**: Once the evaluation of all scripts in a round is complete and Agent 2's instruction set is updated, Agent 1 undertakes a critical analysis to identify which prompt was most effective in yielding the best results.
5. **Refining Agent 1's Prompt-Creation Skills**: Agent 1 updates its own instruction set to improve its prompt-creation skills. This involves learning from the most successful prompts to craft better guidelines in the future, both generally and specifically for Agent 2. This step is crucial as different types of assistant agents require unique instruction sets, tailored to their specific roles or the projects they are involved in.

By refining this process, Agent 1 and Agent 2 engage in a cyclical learning and improvement model, enhancing both script development and prompt generation abilities, tailored to the unique requirements of different agents and project contexts.
5. **Collaborative Learning**: This process allows for a dynamic learning environment where Agent 2 iteratively improves the script based on direct feedback from both Agent 1 and the human agent.

**Example Interaction at the Start of Training**:
- **Agent 1**: "How many versions of the script would you like Agent 2 to develop for this training exercise?"
- **Human Agent**: Provides a specific number (e.g., "Three versions").
- **Agent 1**: Proceeds to instruct Agent 2 based on the human agent's response.

This revised section ensures a collaborative and dynamic training process, involving both AI agents and human input, to enhance the learning and development of AI capabilities in script creation and iterative improvement.
